# Updates for Exchange Server

Exchange follows a quarterly delivery model to release Cumulative Updates (CUs) that address customer-reported issues and to possibly add new functionality and/or features. Critical product updates (packages that address a Microsoft-released security bulletin or contain a change in time zone definitions) are released as needed on a monthly basis for the most recently released CU and the preceding CU.

Each CU is a full installation of Exchange that includes all updates and changes from previous CUs. When installing a new Exchange server using the latest released CU, you don't need to install Exchange RTM or any previously released CU.

To get the latest version of Exchange 2016, download and install [Cumulative Update 16 for Exchange Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyID=6f83a0e2-a1a3-4d46-882b-68de870db3f3). Because each CU is a full installation of Exchange that includes updates and changes from all previous CU's, you don't need to install any previous CU's or Exchange 2016 RTM first.
