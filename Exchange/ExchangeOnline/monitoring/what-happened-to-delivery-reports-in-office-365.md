# What happened to delivery reports in Office 365?

Delivery reports was a feature in Office 365 that allowed users and administrators to discover and view delivery information about mail messages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The feature delivery reports for administrators has been replaced by **Message Trace**.

For more information, see these topics:

- [Trace an email message](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=282262)

- [Message Trace in Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/message-trace-scc?redirectSourcePath=%252farticle%252f3e64f99d-ac33-4aba-91c5-9cb4ca476803)

- [Run a Message trace and view the results in Exchange admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/monitoring/trace-an-email-message/run-a-message-trace-and-view-results)

- [Using Message Trace](https://support.office.com/article/bbf5a330-e83f-43d1-9d51-cfd17d576dd8.aspx)

Currently, there's no direct replacement for delivery reports for users, so the delivery report links in Outlook and Outlook on the web don't go anywhere.

**Notes**:

- Delivery reports for users and administrators is still available in on-premises Exchange environments. For more information, see [Track messages with delivery reports](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=282265).

- Read receipts and delivery notifications aren't related to delivery reports, and are still available in Office 365. For more information, see [Add and request read receipts and delivery notifications](https://support.office.com/article/a34bf70a-4c2c-4461-b2a1-12e4a7a92141.aspx).
