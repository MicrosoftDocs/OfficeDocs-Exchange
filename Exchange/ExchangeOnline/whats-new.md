# What's new in Exchange Online

We're continuously adding new features to Exchange Online, fixing issues as we learn about them, and making changes based on your feedback. On this page, you can find highlights of all the recent changes we've made. Some features get rolled out at different times to our customers, so if you are not seeing a new feature yet, keep checking back.

## March 2020

### What's new in the modern Exchange Admin Center?

As previously announced, Exchange Admin Center (EAC) now uses a new portal at [https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com). This a modern, web-based management console for managing Exchange, designed to provide an experience that is more aligned with the overall M365 admin experience.

For now, it is possible to switch back to the existing EAC (often called the "classic" EAC), but at a future date, the classic EAC will be retired.

#### Recipients

In the modern EAC, the user and shared mailbox management experiences are now merged, and the mailbox list and properties are available on the same page. The option to filter mailboxes based on type can be found on the top right.

Resources experience has been simplified for managing room and resource mailboxes.

#### Migration

Migration is now a first-class citizen under the Modern EAC and is no longer buried inside the Recipient tab as it was in the classic EAC. The major feature additions to the migration flow are:

  - The Exchange and G-Suite migrations are now simple, wizard-based experiences.
  - The G-Suite migration supports migrating Calendar and Contact data along with emails.
  - For G-Suite migration, the 2GB per mailbox per day restriction has been removed.

#### Mail flow  

The Mail flow Experience, which was a part of the Security and compliance portal, is now returning to EAC. As a part of the experience, we have added the following features:

  - Accepted domains
  - Remote domains
  - Connectors
  - Message trace

#### Want to access more features?

As the modern experience is being developed, we are providing deep links from the new portal for users to move to the old portal for completing their work.

To access familiar features that were in the classic Exchange Admin Center, click on the "More features" tab on the left nav and select the feature to open it in a new tab.
