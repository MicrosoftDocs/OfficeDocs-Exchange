# Enable calls from users who aren't UM-enabled in Exchange Online

You can enable or disable calls from users who aren't enabled for Unified Messaging (UM). By default, Unified Messaging allows incoming calls from unauthenticated callers through an auto attendant to be transferred to UM-enabled users. With this option enabled, users from outside an organization can transfer calls to UM-enabled users.

If this setting has been disabled for a UM-enabled user, the user's mailbox can still be located using a directory search. However, if an external caller tries to transfer to the user, the system says, "I'm sorry, I am unable to transfer the call to this user." The caller is then transferred to the operator, if an operator has been configured on the auto attendant. If no operator has been configured on the auto attendant, the call is transferred to a dial plan operator, if one has been configured. If no operator extension has been configured on the speech-enabled auto attendant, the dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) fallback auto attendant, or the dial plan, the system responds by saying, "Sorry. Neither the operator or the touchtone service are available."

For additional management tasks related to users who are enabled for voice mail, see [Voice mail-enabled user procedures](voice-mail-enabled-user-procedures.md).
